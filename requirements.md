# Guard AI – Requirements

## Project Title
Guard AI

## Problem
Today many Indian students and young earners try to make quick money using trading apps, betting platforms or risky investments. Most of them don’t talk about money problems openly because they fear judgement from friends or family.

Because of this, they take wrong financial steps and sometimes fall into debt or scams.

## Goal
Guard AI aims to quietly help youth avoid risky money decisions by giving private alerts and simple guidance before they make mistakes.

## Who it is for
- College students
- Young earners (18–30)
- First-time investors

## Main Features
- Detect risky financial intentions
- Give private alerts
- Show possible loss scenarios
- Suggest safer options
- Keep user privacy

## Why it matters
Many financial mistakes at a young age affect future stability. If youth get early warnings, they can avoid regret later.

## Expected Impact
- Reduce financial losses
- Help youth make safer choices
- Increase awareness about risky decisions
